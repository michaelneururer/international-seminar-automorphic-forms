        The Shintani lift is a classical construction of modular
forms of half-integral weight from modular forms of even integral
weight. Soon after its definition it was shown to be related to
integration with respect to theta kernel. The development of the theory
of regularized integrals opens the question to what modular forms of
half-integral weight arise as regularized Shintani lifts of various
kinds of integral weight modular forms. We evaluate these lifts for the
case of nearly holomorphic modular forms, which in particular shows
that when the depth is smaller than the weight, the Shintani lift is
also nearly holomorphic. This evaluation requires the determination of
certain Fourier transforms, which are interesting on their own right.
This is joint work with Yingkun Li.

            I will talk about the recent proof of universal optimality of the E8 and Leech lattices (and explain what universal optimality means). While the statement itself does not involve any automorphic forms, the key ingredient in the proof is a new kind of interpolation formula for radial Fourier eigenfunctions which turns out to be intimately related to certain vector-valued modular forms for SL(2,Z).
            The talk is based on a joint work with Henry Cohn, Abhinav Kumar, Stephen D. Miller, and Maryna Viazovska.

            The "value" of Klein's modular invariant j at a real quadratic irrationality w has been recently defined using the period of j along the geodesic associated to w in the hyperbolic plane. Works of Duke, Imamoglu, Toth, and Masri establish analogies between these values and singular moduli when they are both gathered in traces. We will talk about the distribution of the values j(w) individually, according to the diophantine approximation of w. Some of our results were conjectured by Kaneko. This is joint work with O.

            In the early 20th century, Hecke studied the diagonal restrictions of Eisenstein series over real quadratic fields. An infamous sign error caused him to miss an important feature, which later lead to highly influential developments in the theory of complex multiplication (CM) initiated by Gross and Zagier in their famous work on Heegner points on elliptic curves. In this talk, we will explore what happens when we replace the imaginary quadratic fields in CM theory with real quadratic fields, and propose a framework for a tentative 'RM theory', based on the notion of rigid meromorphic cocycles, introduced in joint work with Henri Darmon. I will discuss several of their arithmetic properties, and their apparent relevance in the study of explicit class field theory of real quadratic fields. This concerns various joint works, with Henri Darmon, Alice Pozzi, and Yingkun Li.

We describe local Hecke algebras of GL_2 and double cover of SL_2 with certain level structures and use it to give a newform theory. In the integral weight setting, our method allows us to give a characterization of the newspace of any level as a common eigenspace of certain finitely many pair of conjugate operators that we obtain from local Hecke algebras. In specific cases, we can completely describe local Whittaker functions associated to a new form. In the half-integral weight setting, we give an analogous characterization of the newspace for the full space of half-integral weight forms of level 8M, M odd and square-free and observe that the forms in the newspace space satisfy a Fourier coefficient condition that gives the complement of the plus space.

Duke, Imamoḡlu, and Tóth have recently constructed a new geometric invariant, a hyperbolic orbifold, associated to each narrow ideal class of a real quadratic field. Furthermore, they have shown that the projection of these hyperbolic orbifolds onto the modular surface equidistributes on average over a genus of the narrow class group as the fundamental discriminan of the real quadratic field tends to infinity. We discuss a refinement of this result, sparse equidistribution, where one averages over smaller subgroups of the narrow class group: we connect this to cycle integrals of automorphic forms and subconvexity for Rankin-Selberg L-functions.

Congruences of Fourier coefficients of modular forms have long been an object of central study. By comparison, the arithmetic of other expansions of modular forms, in particular Taylor expansions around points in the upper-half plane, has been much less studied. Recently, Romik made a conjecture about the periodicity of coefficients around $\tau=i$ of the classical Jacobi theta function. Here, in joint work with Michael Mertens and Pavel Guerzhoy, we prove this conjecture and generalize the phenomenon observed by Romik to a general class of modular forms of half-integral weight.</div>

We study polyharmonic Maass forms and show that they are related to ray class extensions of real quadratic fields. In particular, we construct a basis for the space of polyharmonic Maass forms for Gamma(N) which is a generalization of a basis constructed by Lagarias and Rhoades for N=1. We show that twisted traces of cycle integrals of certain depth 2 polyharmonic Maass forms are central values of ray class Hecke L-series of real quadratic fields.

        In recent years there has been a lot of interest in explicitly identifying the global Arthur parameters attached to certain automorphic forms. In particular Chenevier and Lannes were able to completely identify and prove the full lists of Arthur parameters in the case of level 1, trivial weight automorphic forms for definite orthogonal groups of ranks 8, 16 and 24 (not a simple task!).
<br />
One finds interesting modular forms hidden in these parameters (e.g. Delta and a handful of special Siegel modular forms of genus 2). Comparing Arthur parameters mod p proves/reproves various Eisenstein congruences for these special modular forms, e.g. the famous 691 congruence of Ramanujan and, more importantly, an example of a genus 2 Eisenstein congruence predicted by Harder (which, up to then, had not been proved for even a single modular form!).
<br />
In this talk I will discuss recent work with Neil Dummigan on extending the above to definite orthogonal groups over certain real quadratic fields and try to tell the analogous Arthurian tales (mysteries included).

                Hurwitz class numbers, class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields, and
                partition counts are among the most classic quantities in number theory,
                and for each of them their factorizations, i.e. divisibilities, are
                celebrated open questions. In the case of class numbers the
                Cohen-Lehnstra Heuristics provides predictions of of statistical nature.
                In the case of partition counts, Ramanujan's congruences have been known
                since~1920 and extended by many including key results by Atkin in the
                60ies and Ono around 2000.

                We investigate the case of divisibility patterns as opposed to
                divisibility statistics for Hurwitz class numbers. The Hurwitz class
                number formula implies Ramanujan-type congruences, which in contrary to
                known congruences for mock theta series can be supported on generating
                series with non-holomorphic modular completion. We prove a result that
                limits the possibilities of such "non-holomorphic" Ramanujan-type
                congruences. When combined with experimental data, this provides
                evidence that all of them arise from the class number formula.

            Conway, Parker and Sloane (and Borcherds) showed that there is
a natural bijection between the Niemeier lattices (the 24
positive-definite, even, unimodular lattices of rank 24) and the deep
holes of the Leech lattice, the unique Niemeier lattice without roots.
<br />
We generalise this statement to vertex operator algebras (VOAs), i.e. we
show that all 71 holomorphic VOAs (or meromorphic 2-dimensional
conformal field theories) of central charge 24 correspond to generalised
deep holes of the Leech lattice VOA.
<br />
The notion of generalised deep hole occurs naturally as an upper bound
in a dimension formula we obtain by pairing the character of the VOA
with a certain vector-valued Eisenstein series of weight 2.

A classical result of Eichler, Shimura and Manin asserts that the map that assigns to a cusp form f its period polynomial r_f is a Hecke equivariant map. We propose a generalization of this result  to a setting  where r_f  is replaced by a family of rational function of N variables equipped with the action of GLN(Z). For this purpose, we develop a theory of Hecke operators for the elliptic cocycle recently introduced by Charollois.  In particular,  when f is an eigenform, the corresponding rational function is also an eigenvector respect to Hecke operator for GLN. Finally, we give some examples  for Eisenstein series and the Ramanujan Delta function.
